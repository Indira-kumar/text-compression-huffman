Introduction:

Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in string. In JS, regex is also an object. there are various different important functions in regular expressions and they are:
- exec() ,
- test(),
- match(), matchAll(), replace(), replaceAll(), search(), and split()

Creating regex:
There are two ways to create regular expressions.
1) Using back slashes, that is enclosing the patterns inside a pair of back slashes.
eg:
const re = /ab+c/;

These regular expressions are compiled when the script is loaded. So they can improive performance.

2) Using RegExp constructor:
Eg:
const re = new RegExp('ab+c');

These are compiled during runtime and can be used when you need to get the regular expression from the user.
